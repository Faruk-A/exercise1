          <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
          <h3>AGREEMENT TO TERMS</h3>
          <p>
            These Terms and Conditions constitute a legally binding agreement
            made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity
            (“you”) and [business entity name] (“we,” “us” or “our”), concerning
            your access to and use of the [website name.com] website as well as
            any other media form, media channel, mobile website or mobile
            application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto
            (collectively, the “Site”). You agree that by accessing the Site,
            you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by all of these
            Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree with all of these Terms
            and Conditions, then you are expressly prohibited from using the
            Site and you must discontinue use immediately. Supplemental terms
            and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Site from time
            to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We
            reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or
            modifications to these Terms and Conditions at any time and for any
            reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last
            updated” date of these Terms and Conditions, and you waive any right
            to receive specific notice of each such change. It is your
            responsibility to periodically review these Terms and Conditions to
            stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed
            to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any
            revised Terms and Conditions by your continued use of the Site after
            the date such revised Terms and Conditions are posted. The
            information provided on the Site is not intended for distribution to
            or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where
            such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or
            which would subject us to any registration requirement within such
            jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to
            access the Site from other locations do so on their own initiative
            and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to
            the extent local laws are applicable. These terms and conditions
            were generated by Termly’s Terms and Conditions Generator. Option 1:
            The Site is intended for users who are at least 18 years old.
            Persons under the age of 18 are not permitted to register for the
            Site. Option 2: [The Site is intended for users who are at least 13
            years of age.] All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which
            they reside (generally under the age of 18) must have the permission
            of, and be directly supervised by, their parent or guardian to use
            the Site. If you are a minor, you must have your parent or guardian
            read and agree to these Terms and Conditions prior to you using the
            Site.
